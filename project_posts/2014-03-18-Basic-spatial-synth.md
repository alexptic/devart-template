Nice quote from great *Charles Babbage's The Ninth Bridgewater Treatise*, which surprisingly very good fit and describe of current project idea.

####Back to technical stuff...
I’ve desided to start from idea of the simple synth as the engine for Generator logic. The idea is based on architecture of additive synthesis. Links for reference:

Algorithm based on relative location of travelers and its geometric interpretation. Let travelers are located as shown on the picture.

Distance between current (highlighted) traveler and other travelers (L1-L4) interpreted as imagined spatial string. Frequency, generated by the real physical string (on guitar, for example) calculated by following formula:

![formula](../project_images/formula_string.png?raw=true "formula")

Here:
  *fn* - frequency of n-th harmonic,
  *n* - number of harmonic,
  *L* - length of the string,
  *v* - speed of propagation of sound in current environment


See for details:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrating_string
http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/waves/string.html

For first approach in implementation we make two assumption:
1. Calculate only first harmonic for each “string” (distance). Thus, n equal 1.
2. *V* value will be chosen by reasons of applicability. “Environment” in this project is pure virtual, so this reason is fair enough :)

From each presented travelers algorithm gets distance *Ln*, then calculated frequency *fn* of the wave from it. Amplitude *An* is equal to distance. Phase of the wave equal to azimuth for each of travelers. This three parameters is enough to generate basic waveform. This waveform has becomes the oscillator in additive synth scheme.

![synth](../project_images/add_synth.png?raw=true "synth")

Result of this chain is base waveform for current traveler at this place and time. This waveform linked to current area and included in next generated waves from this place. This algorithm repeated for each of connected travelers for calculating their individual waveforms.

####Themes for further exploration:
- Sonically highlight travelers current waveform. Traveler must clearly hear, that his location affects on result sound.
- More representative methods of retrieving amplitude and phase.
- Dynamic of generated waveforms.
    - timeline, order of playing sounds;
    - duration of each waveform;
    - connection between speed of travelers and dynamics. 
- Types of waveforms (sin, triangle, square, saw)
- Melodic representation.
- ADSR model  envelop’s for filtering and dynamics.

- Individual mixing.
- Various modulations and its sources.
