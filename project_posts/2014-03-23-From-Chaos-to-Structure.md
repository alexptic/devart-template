This post presents several thoughts about **SoundMemory** feature. 

####Stage 1. Filling the memory.
Let the traveler is walking through previously unexplored area. During the walk, system gets traveler's location data with some predefined period of time (every 1 minute, for example). After location data retrieving server-side generates waveform (see *Simple spatial synth* post for detail) and save it into database, along with current travelerâ€™s coordinates. At this stage we create relation in database between the area of the city and the sound, waveform.

####Stage 2. Applying of SoundMemory.
After a while, other traveler is walking in this area. It could be not exactly the same route, but closer to it.
During the sound's generating, the *Generator* gets previously saved waveform for current area and makes *The Operation* between just created waveform and *SoundMemory's* form (marked with grey color). Thus, traveler hears combination of these waveforms.

*The Operation*( (triangle symbol on picture) is the subject of researches. Possible variants:
- echo/delay effect (SoundMemory waveform processing with  echo effect);
- simple addition of waveforms;
- modulations;

Problem here is from one hand is to make clear for traveler to hear and define his own waveform and from the other - creating complex sound.

####Stage 3. Musical information retrival.
For melodical approach we could retrival possible note information from the *SoundMemory* for current area or point.

Interesting technology solution for this is Essentia library for audio analysis and audio-based music information retrieval:

Further development of this stage is musical scale forming, creating from clusters of notes and relations between them.
