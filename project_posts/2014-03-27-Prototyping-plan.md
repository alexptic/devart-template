Draft plan for prototyping.

1. Browser application with local web-server. Map as central widget, with ability of free setting of test "sound source" (red markers on picture) by clicking on map. Location of sources would be transmited through local TCP (or UDP) socket to the PureData (MaxMsp) patch. This setup is basis for testing and research of Sound Generator module.

2. The Audio Spectator Tool - clicking at the markers on the map for switch to current traveler and changing mix structure. This addition is usefull for Individual Mix feature testing.
3. Emulation of moving sources. At this stage, Collector prototype would added into application, prepared testing locations data of the sources, and script wich sends data to the Collector. This addition is usefull for offline testing of Generator and Collector modules.
![proto2](../project_images/proto2.png?raw=true "proto2")
4. One-client mode testing. At this stage first prototype of Android applicaton would be created and connected to the prototype application. SoundMemory feature and local mixing testing at this stage.
5. Streaming feature was added.

![proto3](../project_images/proto3.png?raw=true "proto3")
6. Porting the application to the web server-side.
7. Usres management system.
8. Multiple mobile clients testing, improvements of Android application.
