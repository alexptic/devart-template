## Description
###Core idea

Network sonic service. Users (“travelers”) can connect to the web-service using custom smarphone application. Application sends travelers’s coordinats to server. Server collecting location data of the travelers, generate from it music composition (soundscape) and stream it back to the traveler. Moving of the traveler change soundscape.  Thus, traveler becomes listener and the “source” of the sound at the same time.

###Core features

####1.Individual mix

Each user hears his own version of composition (soundscape) depending of his location. Server generate individual mix for each connected user.  For example - highlights melodic line, specific for current area, or changes timbral characteristics of sound. 

####2.Sound memory of the area

Amount of users, which visited some area of the city, affects on next generated sounds from this area. Area has some kind of memory. For example - street where already been 10 users sounds different than street on which been only 2 users, and both sounds different than abandoned street.
